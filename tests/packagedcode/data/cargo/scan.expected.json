Limitations on Grant Scope\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\nor\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\nmodifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\nContributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\nVersion); or\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\nits Contributions.\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n2.4.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\nForm, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\nthe Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\nForm by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\nthan the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n3.4.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.
